So we thought we'd talk about privacy, because you're all being photographed, so what the hell? Abuse wherever, but the idea is to talk about and focus on the differences between the U.S. System and the European, and in particular an area of privacy that Europe just had its first case, which involves both privacy and news gathering. And in this case, it was the use of hidden cameras, hidden microphones. John, in his life, particularly focusing on television, is one of the U.S.'s most experienced lawyers in dealing with this, and is not necessarily the beginning, but perhaps the end of that process, and how both courts and news reacted. But Mark, maybe start from the proposition of this case, Haldeman, versus Switzerland, sort of what happened there, and then maybe we can talk about sort of how it's different and what the approach and what significance of that is. 'Well there were four Swiss journalists, TV journalists, excuse me, frog in my throat, who worked for the rather snappily named Swiss TV program, Kassen Sturz. And they had got approval from their editors to do some hidden camera filming. There had been problems with insurance brokers giving. What might best be described as sub-optimal advice. And so basically, they wanted to be able to get the evidence of this. And they put cameras in a room, the court came to the conclusion that A, that there was low quality advice being given, two, that the insurance broker had a reasonable expectation of privacy, That's the touchstone test that we have that he had a reasonable expectation of privacy and also reasonable expectation that the information that he imparted would not be amplified through electronic media or any other way. And they noted a rather interesting point which was that the journalists having reviewed the material after they'd recorded it had only used the really bad stuff. Which showed, in their view, the high public interest. So by not showing lots and lots of material and limiting it to the really bad stuff, that was a greater justification for the intrusion into his privacy. And the conclusion that they came to was that the broker had a private life. He was entitled to protection of that. He had an expectation of it. But in this particular. Set of circumstances, the public interest trumped his right to privacy. And so there was the right for the journalists to speak. Now this is quite important because the essential fact that I haven't told you is that there is a complete statutory bar on doing any hidden camera recording at all in Switzerland. What the European Court of Human Rights have done is effectively put a gloss on a complete blanket statutory ban and said, yeah, you can have a statutory ban, but you've got to be able to be flexible enough to take where it's appropriate the opportunity to have a public interest defense. And part of that was that we put forward a series of programs which we had taken in the UK or had been made in the U.K., which where there isn't a statutory ban. And so we had things like a Channel 4 program about the abuse of corpses at funeral parlors. We did one about the abusive animals at dogs' homes and things like that. And of course, there's nothing worse to an English person than abuse of their dog, as you will have seen in Downton recently, I'm sure. Or if not, you've got that coming. Sorry, a spoiler, yeah. The worst, of course was the program that was made about the abuse of disabled folk, some... Mentally disabled some, physically disabled some both, who were physically and otherwise abused by their carers. And I think that that gave the court a very clear understanding of the utility of public. 'But England doesn't have an absolute bar against hidden cameras and microphones. But so John, I mean, we talked earlier today about a couple cases which actually, and again, these go, this is the first case to the European Court of Human Rights on the issue of the hidden camera, hidden microphone. There's a history of this in the United States which is long, tortured, complicated, and has made John, not a wealthy man, but a well-employed man for a number of decades. 'And a well-informed man. So that's not clear. First, could I ask, could the lights be turned down a little bit so this feels more like a conversation, less like an interrogation? Thank you. Thank you very much. And I would just like, and I see several of my students in here, so they know that this approach, taken in this British case, or the Swiss case, before the European Court, is very different from the way American courts have treated news gathering issues like this, like trespass, like use of hidden cameras, like serve justice recording. Because American courts has said, it is not a defense, if you violate the law I'll commit a tort. The news gathering tactic that you use, the newsworthiness of your report is not a defense. They're not going to balance it. So, and a dramatic example of that in California some years ago, Group W productions for a series on EMS workers. Did some recording, they put recording device on EMS workers and Oh, sorry, okay. And one of them went and tended to a woman who had been trapped under a car off the highway and recorded conversation with her as she was trapped in the car and then later as they flew off in a helicopter to a hospital. They never showed that woman's face. They never identified her by name, but she did recognize herself by voice and by circumstance. And she sued for two things. She sued for invasion of privacy, for the broadcast of embarrassing private facts about her, and for intrusion for the secret recording. And the same court, the California Supreme Court, held that no, she lost on the invasion of privacy for private facts because this was a legitimately newsworthy matter they were covering, the operations of healthcare workers. But the court ruled in her favor and said she could pursue a claim for intrusion. The news gathering was separate. So the newsworthiness did not rescue the group W from the tort for the intrusion, and that's a different approach. Do you expect this to be carried over throughout Europe? Yeah, I mean it goes beyond just Switzerland because of course it's in the European Court of Human Rights and that applies to countries as diverse as Russia and Turkey and all the sort of rather odd countries who are not even in the EU, so think European Union plus all the bits around the edges and you've got a major change in the law and approach in every single one of these countries. And I think... So, you know, you're still going to have to show that you thought about, first of all, that it was necessary to reveal serious wrongdoing or criminality. So you're going to to have thought that going in, so you'll have to have had a good tip or some information which would lead you to that conclusion. You'll have get senior editorial approval, who will then have to document why they made that approval. Then you will have the secret camera recording, and then reviewing that, there's a second decision to be made about whether or not you're going to further intrude beyond the secret recording, because obviously that's a, if you like, a smaller invasion of privacy than to amplify that through the general broadcast to the world at large. And so, Those are the sorts of, and that's the decision tree that we have to make and we have justify. But it's incredibly good if you go back to, oh there was a woman who, an American journalist who impersonated herself into a mental institution in New York, centuries ago I think. And effectively it's the same kind of case and test. There's a real understanding that you can get through this. No, we have done... Right, so this guy's right to privacy applies even though he was an insurance broker, the journalist posed as someone seeking insurance. They met in a rented space of some sort, like a hotel room. So it's classic in a sense, consumer reporting in that sense. And so here, because of the fact that the news worthiness does not trump the intrusion because of that secret recording. There was a case, we talked about this one earlier, Desnick, which was an ophthalmologist, and there, that report was, which you could just discuss a little bit, but that report protected, but as a result of a change in the law, no longer occurs. Yeah, that was an ABC News piece that sent in some of the hidden cameras to a clinic that had been accused of doing unnecessary and actually dangerous surgeries on patients' eyes. And ABC sent in some patients for whom actually this surgery would be not only unnecessary, but dangerous. And yes, it was recommended to them anyway, and they captured that interaction on hidden camera. The clinic sued ABC, in ABC. One, because, among other things, that kind of hidden camera was lawful in Illinois at that time. As Stuart mentioned, though, today there was later a change in Illinois law, and under Illinois law now recording of private conversations is the audio that's at issue, but the recording would be illegal. So when someone would come to me now and say, oh, we want to do a piece about ophthalmologists and unnecessary surgeries. And we want to capture that conversation, and we're looking at Illinois, I would have to say, despite the newsworthiness and importance of the reporting, we better look at some other states, because we can't capture that interaction. 'I mean, it's quite interesting that, you know, that's a problem, because the news-gathering process isn't a problem. I mean you know invariably within, well not invariably, but very often within camera there is that impersonation element that you refer to Stuart in the sense that you know you go in and you pretend to be someone and you know it's a, we have a situation where other programs. I mean, I was thinking particularly of the Food Lion case over here where, you of Sarah O'Rourke. Also ABC. Also ABC, how does this happen? Food line were basically, as I understand it, cutting the green bits off out of date meat, repackaging it, and putting it back on the shelves. So you had somebody go in. And that's perfectly possible for us. I mean, we have to be able to show that the individual reporter hasn't gained. So the money that they're paid as a worker has to go into a trust account and has to back afterwards. But basically, that's... Perfectly cool as far as we're concerned. I've always been gobsmacked at that decision but it's always down to that distinction that you have which we just don't. Well, but ultimately Foodland ABC did win. Oh, did you? Oh, I didn't, for two dollars. We won almost everything. We ended up paying two dollars... So the honor was satisfied. On a minor trespassing. Well, I mean, I think it's interesting you raise that, because one of the things that happened, because the first time I became cognizant of sort of the news gathering talks that you have here, the attack on news gathering by attacking the actual processes, was in Food Lion and when that was going on, and I predicted it would happen in the UK, and it hasn't. It's taken until basically the last 18 months to begin a process of that, and so. We're now seeing claims in trespass, in harassment, in order to try and preclude the gathering of information. But you don't. That this sort of approach, that the newsworthiness, the importance of the reporting, will trump the news gathering toward, or crime? Would that even extend to a physical trespass? Yeah, I mean, I think the courts are basically going to say, well, you know, you walked on someone's front lawn in order to get pictures of wrongdoing. A couple of broken blades of glass, that doesn't warrant any money. Similarly, I can see situations where people are using drones to fly over without anybody's knowledge and effectively trespassing in the airspace. And I think that that again is going to be dealt with as an invasion of privacy. In fact, you know, our celebrities now expect it, so if you're buying Hello or Okay, and I know that there's some of you out there that are addicted, I can see you are, madam. And they, it's all our little guilty secret, I am too. And, but now when they sell the weddings and things, the car pulls up into a tent. The flaps are let down and everybody walks in under a covered walkway because, you know, there's so many drones around and all the rest of it. And I was talking to a friend of mine, Amal Clooney, who was getting married in Venice a little while ago. And she said she had no idea until she saw the pictures that there were drones all over the Grand Canal taking pictures of her going to and from the wedding and wedding reception. Well, drone use. By journalists has proceeded more quickly than in the US, where it's been held back here by the FAA. But across Europe and most of the world, it is just flourishing freely, right? Yeah, no, it's amazingly good fun because we, but perfectly happily, you don't even need to be qualified. Anything that weighs up to 22 kilos, and that's basically the size of my wife's luggage when she checks in. It's really big. And that's the sort of size of something falling out of the sky. And that, you do need to qualified for that. Now, of course. The BBC, being the BBC have got someone who's a former aviation pilot, who's got a proper license and all the rest of it, and they notify people and they do everything very properly, but this prevention which you have, which is that if you're the person who took the film or the journalist who uses it does it for commercial gain, then it suddenly becomes illegal and problematic. We just don't have that issue. So if you want to go take drone pictures, off you go. And the only preventative issue is really privacy. Is there an invasion of privacy? Do you have a legitimate expectation? Right, because the oddity about Haldeman and the secret camera is that the Europeans sue for privacy much more, especially minor royals in money laundering countries. And they tend to prevail at least for some period of time, or they stand outside wearing either not the top and not the bottom, or not both, and tend to be members of the royal family in England. And they sue and they win, they get some sort of money. So there's this protection of privacy, which is really quite surprising, if you look at it from an American perspective. And yet on something like this, which is American jurisprudence has no problem basically punishing the hidden microphone in the ambulance and wouldn't look at news worthiness. In fact, it goes the other way there and it's more, you can do more there than you can here. Really quite extraordinary. I'm not sure it's rational. I'm sure which is the better system, but it's different. Yeah, you can gather anything you want. The question is, can you exploit it? And, you know, so you have... So walk through that. Well, let's take a situation which I had to deal with was some drone pilots decided that Paris Hilton was of interest, and she was doing, she was on the Cote d'Azur. Topless, as everybody on the Côte d'Azur is, and they got the shots of her and then the question. With a dron. And the question was, you know, how do you deal with that? We have similar issues, I mean. So how did you deal that? Well, we just published. I mean, you, I, I. I mean they, she had a. Did you do a legal analysis, or you just wrote that down? Yeah, yeah, well, yeah what? There were two things, really. Where would we be sued? And so clearly, she could sue us in France, but the French are very keen on these legal actions, but they don't actually think much about the term in terms of damages. She could have sued us in London. Dutch is cake up with like 15,000 including, sorry. Yeah, and you know, if you think about the intrusion for the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate, she, and that was at the topless pictures, so they were taken at a chateau in France, which has a long tradition of history with the royal family, I'll tell you about that in a minute, but the image was on every national newspaper, it was all over the world, closer went to about four or five reprints. As a consequence of it. There's the French magazine that I actually published in. Yeah, absolutely, and so there was a lot of intrusions. So 15,000 euros is not a lot of money for that, and of course, you know, they've had more in terms of profit. I mean, they've probably made a couple of hundred thousand on the back of that. So the economics of that are not a disincentive. The English have taken a slightly different approach in the sense that we do give seriously large awards for damages. So. For the phone hacking, which we've had recently. The Daily Mirror has rather foolishly in my judgment taken all of these cases to court and the judges cannot restrain themselves. So the awards have been sort of 150,000, 250,000 pounds. Pounds, yeah. Yeah, and it's important to just put that in context. So we don't have jury awards or indeed the awards like Stewart lost 240 million. And won. And won, and won, yes, I appreciate you. You know, you did well afterwards. Second time out. We're all great affiliate lawyers. Yeah. But the important thing to remember is that if you lose the site in one eye in the UK, we've got a kind of tariff for it. We actually have a book with all the things in. So it's about 10 to 15,000 pounds for the loss of an eye, permanent loss of vision. If you, and part of the rationale for that is that you've got another one. And similarly, losing the forearm below the elbow, so somewhere around here, that's going to be, again, about 10 to 15,000 pounds. So personally, I would prefer to be photographed from the top off and publicly humiliated than to have that physical difference. But that is the difference. And in terms of libel, we have a cap on libel of 230,000 lbs. So if I call John a pedophile murderer on the front page of every national newspaper, that's the maximum that he can get in terms of damages. So privacy awards have kind of got out beyond them. But going back to the chateau in France, the infamous Royal Chateau, which is rented out to, or lent to. Members of the royal family. Charles used to go there with Camilla when he was still married to Diana for their summer holiday, so they'd go away for a month and, well, be together. And one of my clients was a photographer who discovered where they went, and so he went down and took a photograph of Charles getting changed through... The bedroom window in the evening as the sun was going down. And fortunately for Charles, unfortunately for the photographer, the sun, was on the window at the time and the photographer didn't have a UV filter for the lens which was that long and about that wide. And so, there was this sort of, well sort of a glow around the crown jewels and so anyway he was not content with this photograph. The Germans published that wasn't it, in Bill? The next year he goes back, this year he's bought, you know, £6.95, a UV filter that will fit over this thing and he gets the shot which demonstrates that A, the moil has been round and B, that the... You know, you see the full Crown Jewels and all the rest of it. And he has the problem. Not a privacy problem, you might think. The problem is that nobody will publish it, because it's too rude. Except, of course, the Italians. It's always the Italians, isn't it? Well, the Italian's came up with a rather ingenious solution, and what they did was they put Um put it on the front cover of a magazine, and put a black box over the crown jewels, and on the black box it said, for the full uncensored image, take a two euro coin and scratch off, and you've got all these Italian matrons scratching away, which I thought was genius, It's an evil genius, but genius nonetheless. Okay, so that's one aspect of privacy. Or not, always change indoors, it's a reminder. But then other aspects of privacy and a difference with the U.S. would be what's commonly known as the right to be forgotten. Which is actually the right to be harder to find or the right to be obscure and if I can find this. Ah, there it is. So this is the thing, right? Yeah, this is what we're all concerned with. Right, so what this is not about, I'll start with that and you can say what it's about. It's not about this is the original notice that reports this guy has a financial problem. Yeah, and that's on their website and it's not taking down off their website. This is about something different. What's this about? So, this is the actual print edition of La Vanguardia and under Spanish law, when you had... This, by the way... This, by the way, is the guy, right? Yeah. Yeah, it is. So you'll never forget him. Yeah, this is the most famous deadbeat in history, Mr. Gonzales. If you meet him, ask him what he did 16 years ago. But he became slightly embarrassed about this thing. And it was the only, when he put his name into the Google search engine, it was only thing that came up about him because he was pretty anonymous. And so he wanted this to be forgotten. He'd moved on with his life. And he was now a successful lawyer. Um, and, uh, no longer a property dealer and so on and so forth. And so he took this case on the right to be forgotten. Now, this is a form of privacy law that we have. It's a data regulation and basically it says that you have to, the information has to be up to date, it has to accurate and it has to be proportionate and all the rest of it. It has to be relevant, basically. And so. So you delete it if it's inadequate, irrelevant, no longer relevant, or excessive, in relation to the purposes of the processing, the processing of the data carried out by the operator of the search engine. So what could be excessive is a whole separate question, but anyway. 'Yeah, but I mean, you know, basically what you've got is, he's saying it's no longer relevant. It's effectively, you now, yesterday's news. And so he wanted it removed. Now, he tried, he initially started proceedings against La Vanguardia and Google, but dropped the case against LaVanguardia very quickly because he recognized that there's a defense, which is that journalists are entitled to keep. Material in their archives for journalistic purposes. So, La Vanguardia are in the clear. But Google is merely a search engine according to the European Court. And as a commercial search engine, they are obliged to process data. That is, they're supposed to behave appropriately in relation to data. And they don't get the journalistic exemption. So, anyone. Who doesn't like a story about themselves or believes it falls into the categories can now apply to have it removed or effectively airbrushed from history because you are de-linked. The right to be forgotten is quite an emotive term, but basically it's de-linking. So it's like going, I think it's a bit like going into a library and leaving the book on the shelf. But taking out the library card that tells you where it is. So you could spend months and months trying to find it, but you probably wouldn't bother. And that's really what this is about. And there are many hundreds of thousands, many millions of them now. Them being requests. Requests for them to come down. About 48% are successful in terms of them, but the tension really is now, whereas people were happy just to have them removed from .uk or .fr for France or .sp for Spain, now people want them removed here on the .com domains. Right, so the U.S., if this happened, what happens, John, under U. S. Law? 'I mean, unless you have a good old-fashioned kind of libel suit or invasion of privacy suit and you go after the original publisher. But Google and the search engines, it would not be liability. 'It's a non-live, it's non-bible. Um. I actually, some of my students will have just written an essay for me about, would they recommend that this sort of right to be forgotten be enacted in the U.S.? And if it were enacted, if there were an attempt to enact it, would it be constitutional? And overwhelmingly, the class said something with which I agree, which is that it could not, it could lawfully be enacted. It would be found unconstitutional. Which is what the tension is. So the French regulators are the one, I think, most actively pursuing this. But they are corresponding monthly with Google, saying you've got to take this off Google.com, not just off Google ES or FR. And Google's so far refusing. Presumably that gets litigated now, right? What happens? The decision that's come down, they took it to the highest court in Spain and then the highest court of Spain referred it to European Union court who makes the definitive rulings for the whole of the European Union because our laws have to be harmonized. They go back to data regulation. That's this one, but the issue of taking it off Google.com, that's at this point regulatory, right? So what, yeah. Well, that hasn't gone to the, the European Court of Human Rights has not ruled on. No. Yeah. Just France. 'Well, a number of countries are coming up with very similar things because, of course, there are German citizens, French and Spanish, but you're right, the French are being particularly aggressive about this, but so are the Germans. The Germans have got a very particular view about privacy. I think a lot of it is informed by Angela Merkel's experience, their chancellor, on her growing up. In East Germany, in a starsy state. For those of you that have seen the movie, The Lives of Others, where people are bugged regularly. It was something that she finds, or it does find, personally very, very distasteful and problematic. And I think that, and also the disclosure by Edward Snowden that the American government was listening to her telephone calls, I think didn't improve things. So. There is this tension where they want to push, because they see it as an ineffectual or half-hearted remedy if you take it off European domains, but leave it on dot com. But how do they exercise jurisdiction? So assume none of them like it. Do they fine Google France, which then puts the fine back to Google California? If they come to this country, it won't work. They can't actually get an order in the US court, probably. Yeah, I mean, it's a problem, because what they're doing is they're fining people who don't have the power to do it. So Google's corporate structure is Google Inc, Google Ireland, which is the holding company for the European Union, and then each country of the European union has its own company. So there's Google France. So Google France is basically an advertising sales operation. There's no mechanicals, there's no ability to control data, all of that is held, and deliberately so, in California. And as a result of that, that's the structure that happens. So what they're trying to do is to exercise such pain on the sub of the sub that the... The mother company will take action, or will be forced to take action. So daily fines have been addressed. Only 2,000 to 3,000 euros a day. Over one. Over one incident. And you've got to remember that there are literally hundreds of thousands of those. And so those are the sorts of issues that we're seeing in play at the moment. But it's this issue of jurisdiction and who can do what where. So John, tell us about that picture and what happened in the United States. 'Does anyone in this audience know who that white-haired gentleman is? Paul Weller. I'm so pleased, you must be from Woking, sir! A minor figure here in the U.S., mostly as leader of the rock group, the late 70s rock group, The Jam, and then later The Style Council. But he knew the whole history. He gave me five minutes. It's still a major figure in England, apparently, I guess so. Small country. This photograph is of him and two children, is that right? Of his. They're twins, yeah. Resting in a cafe in Santa Monica, California, snapped by a paparazzo, whom Weller actually then confronted. The paparazzzo assured him that they would not show the children's faces, but then they went on to do so, and this, and a whole series of photographs, published in the Mirror, in a British tabloid. And Weller, Online, online. But British publication, and Weller sued in England. And even though he and the court acknowledged that the taking of the photographs was lawful in California and that publishing them in California or New York or the U.S. Would be lawful, he successfully, his lawsuit in England against the British publication was successful because of their feelings. Uh... That the privacy of the children deserve protection I mean this is a really interesting development and we're seeing it increasingly used because of course countries which don't have protections for privacy or don't have, as far as celebrities are concerned, adequate protections for privacy are nearly all signed up to the International Covenant for the protection of the rights of the child, the US is, everybody is. Even you know some of the Gulf countries are and the key to that is that they when you get the letters before action in London What they say because the immediate thing you say as well. It was published It was pretty taken in America. You haven't got any legitimate expectation of privacy given the local law They then say well, you're not remembering the International Covenant on the rights of the child And the child is the person who brings it and of course In this particular instance, although it's Weller who's angry and it's Weller whose giving the instructions to the lawyers, the case is brought in the name of the children. Right, so the woman with the glasses is actually his daughter, identifying the caption as his wife. That was one mistake. But the children are 10 months old, and they got, I think, 5,000 each because of the trauma they suffered at the age of 10 months for having their pictures published. Well, the pram photograph, yes. But I mean, it's an easy mistake with the wife. I mean she's, the daughter's 16 and the wife's 26. So, you know. Weller is 54. Allegedly and total damages were 10,000 pounds. So again, it goes to the point but in England elite legal fees would have been in the hundreds of thousands. Yeah, no I mean Well, it's not in this case, but it is. You get the key thing in the UK is that the legal fees are going to be expensive. They did a survey a few years ago on libel cases, but privacy cases are the same. Basically, it's 150 times more expensive to sue for libel or privacy in the U.K. And Ireland than it is anywhere else in Europe. But see this, where Mark and I got to know each other was over 15 years of litigation over these forum shopping libel plaintiffs. So Russians came into the UK, Middle Easterners came into UK, Arnold Schwarzenegger went to the UK. Liberace won the lawsuit proving he was not gay, or couldn't be proved that he was gay. So he won damages, Elton John won damages on the same point. And by and large, we got rid of that through forum, basically saying you belonged in a different court. But privacy now is extremely attractive to run the same arguments. And those costs objectives, since they're gonna go in front of judges who will be disinclined to approve pictures of children or pictures of whatever else, they're going to be in a very friendly court. They'll all talk about the children. And in all probability, what you'll see is a surge of this stuff as the firms migrate away from defamation and into privacy, no? Well, it's already happening. We're seeing, I think we've had four libel trials this year. But we've something like 40, 45 privacy trials. So that gives you, which in a smallest jurisdiction, is a lot. And there's significant normal cases. Think of the. Multiple of that that's settled because the prospect of 'I mean that's the tip of the iceberg, and so as a result of that, and if you get a letter before action, even in a libel claim, you invariably get a privacy claim and a data claim at the same time, and they are sort of interchangeable, I mean if you think fun boss. For the Grand Prix racing and he decided to entertain four or five prostitutes in a Chelsea basement and one of the prostitues had what's well that well-known news gathering article a bra cam and she sold the story to News of the World and they publish it all over the front page. He sued for libel in Germany, and he sued for invasion of privacy in the UK. His libel theory was, because the News of the World's headline was Nazi orgy, and so basically his theory was that this was a commonel garden British orgy. And he was entitled to the extra diminution in value and loss of reputation for it actually being wrongly identified as a Nazi orgy. So if we just said on the headline, good British orgy in Chelsea, presumably he wouldn't have got any libel damages. Anyway, he won his privacy case and set the bar for damages at about 60,000 then, but they've gone way up from there. There's no jury, they're all being set by judges, and judges are finding very fact-specifically ways of getting at higher awards. So they're starting to break down the wrongs, the torts. They're starting say, well, you effectively looked at somebody's private material on several different occasions, so I'm gonna give you the maximum award each time, so we're gonna total them up. Okay, well, they went into your phone records, we'll give you 50,000 every time they did it. So four or six times they did, that starts to get to be a meaningful, sensible number. And part of that, I think, is a sort of policy decision that the judges are making, is to exhibit their distaste at what some of the less classy ends of the English media have been up to. It does seem that. English law and European law. Presents a greater degree of subjectivity and lodges it in the judge than American law on news gathering and I'd say privacy. Defamation as well. And, yes, and definitely. Yeah, and I think part of that is, of course, we have to remember that although we bequeath the legal system to you, we don't have a constitution. You have a Constitution, you have a Bill of Rights, all of which are meaningful and have an effect on the way in which your law is interpreted and actually allows people. To speak openly and freely and all the rest of it. And we have this rather peculiar situation where we've never thought that people should have the right to speak freely and so our libel laws are very claimant friendly. They're, even now, I would think 90% of cases are run, won by claimants. So it really is, I mean that's why it's called the libel capital of the world because you basically have to be a moron in a hurry to lose a case there. And then of course what's happened is as we've joined the EU and also we signed up to the European Convention on Human Rights, increasingly these continental notions and the case law from the continent about privacy have come forward. So. You know, the sort of ideas that sort of emerge from France, but many of the other countries where the president can have four or five mistresses, but not a single newspaper will report it because of their privacy laws. Those kinds of laws are coming in, you know up our rivers into our estuaries and into the streams. And that really is affecting the way in which the legal system. Is responding to claims and the problems of what are perceived as invasions by the media. So sort of our time is done. But does anybody have any questions, comments? Anyone want to assault Mark? He's good at it. He's robust. He can take it. Yeah, thanks for being brave. Sure, I'm just hoping you or any of you would speak a little more about the extra territoriality of these judgments, because it's not just France, but there's also Canada, British Columbia court issued an order against Google to take something down. In Australia this month, I think, did the same of removing a defamation link. You're sort of seeing the Commonwealth countries draw ranks to punch holes in Google. And to me, it just doesn't seem good, but where is this gonna end and what next? I think it's a very pertinent question and I'm glad you asked it, thank you. What I do is I start off by looking at what would we be doing if this was a company selling widgets or undertaking some business abroad and you look at whether they've got a business in the country that you're doing business in. Are they selling products there? What is the structure that you're looking at? And invariably, it's difficult to get jurisdiction over somebody who's not there or jurisdiction over somebody who is it's merely a subsidiary. And what the continentals are doing particularly is attacking these tech companies through their subsidiaries. I think is just jurisprudentially wrong, but it is what they're doing. And I think it's setting very bad precedents because there are, when you play this back the other way, so let's say Iran decides to start making judgments against or take something somewhere that's slightly less controversial, Turkey, which has a big sort of clothes industry and other kinds of industry, you start playing those back the way and you want to have proceedings brought, but you have deliberately set up a subsidiary in Turkey, which has very limited scope. All the decisions are actually made back in London or New York, it doesn't much matter. Then in those circumstances, that corporate structure should be respected. The laws the world over have been designed to respect that corporate structures. And what we've got here is a situation where they're not respecting the corporate structure and I think that is the problem. They're not playing by the rules anymore and that's going to set really bad precedence in just trade areas, irrespective of the ICT parts of it. And I think they're looking at saying, well, you know, these people can effectively broadcast into our jurisdictions or they can communicate into our jurisdiction and Therefore, we should be able to do something about that. Just take that one stage further. You know, the Turks don't like it if you say rude things about Atatürk. You know he's a national symbol. And effectively, they've attacked YouTube and other online spaces where those individuals have said things about Ataturk which are not entirely praising. And I think we're starting to erode at this notion of individual rights and all the rest of it. And that's why I made the point. In Spain, it was an advertising sales office. That's all it did. The data wasn't even held in Ireland. There was no data held in Spain. No executive, no employee had the power to do anything in Spain and it's only people at the head office in California that have the power to do everything. So what is happening is that there is an abuse. The legal construct that we have devised for centuries of the corporation. And that those countries were fully participant in. They wanted to get the local office because they wanted people to basically advertise. They wanted people market globally. And so what they're doing is they're sacrificing that participation potentially at the altar of this fetishization of these issues. There's nothing about this that's inaccurate. It's a question of whether it's been around too long. And to elevate that over the ability to participate in a global technology economy and there are probably other reasons for this as well. But that's what they're doing. And the question is, at what point does the cost get so high for the Googles that they simply say, you come to California and contract with us, because we're not going to bother. We're not going have Google France. Or Google France will actually be run out of servers in California. You can do that easily enough. 'Yeah, I think that's right, and I mean, I mean I think it is important to say that, you know, the right-to-be-forgotten stuff applies to honest, truthful information. Never forget them, never forget them. Yeah. And the advertisement was a statutory form advertisement required to be put in by legislation in Spain. Sorry, yes. Hi, I'm another Brit in the room. You talked about it briefly earlier. You've obviously got this tension now between undercover reporting and this public interest test, and then the idea of trespass. I was wondering if you think you're going to start seeing public interest coming in as almost an excuse to trespass in these situations, and whether you could then see that extending to things like theft and surveillance in terms of voicemails and phone hacking. That's a very good question. In fact, I had a case over the last six weeks where the target went to criminal lawyers to advise. And what they did was that they laid a trap. So, when the journalists went round to the office... By appointment to interview senior executives for the article, they had slipped onto the signing in book key documents which were relevant to the story. And we managed to get hold of the video footage of them actually putting them there. And of course the journalist did what any of your journalists would do was picked them up and took them off to read them. There was no intention to permanently deprive, no intention steal them, but obviously want to take them away, look at them more carefully. And so what they were trying to do was then prosecute and criminalize the journalists through theft. And that was what the game, the game that that was afoot. So we are seeing people really starting to push the boundaries on these things and attack in a very aggressive way. The news gathering side of things. But I think we are going to see increasing problems with news gathering. Because of course when, as it is the case in Australia at the moment, they don't have privacy laws like we have, like the UK used to be before the continentals infected us with their privacy. Then in those circumstances, you can still do long lens photography, you can still... Pat people, you can still do all of that stuff there. And that, I think, is quite an interesting tension because you're gonna find this patchwork around the world when some countries where you can do these things and some countries when you can't. And what do you do when you cross borders with the images and the information? So I think that concludes it for the evening, but if we can all give a round of applause to our three speakers this evening. Thank you so much, and especially to Mark. Thank you for coming to visit us tonight, and we hope you all stick around for the reception in the back of the room. Hi. I wanted to talk briefly about injunctions against publications. This is something that, at least in my class, we'll talk about in a serious way, a very serious point, about injunctions on grounds of national security, and we'll read the Pentagon Papers case. What I want to talk about now is actually a different kind of case in which people seek injunctions. The impact, though, of that effort to seek an injunction. Is the same and that is that it seeks an order that silences the press and prevents the publication of information that the press has whether that's a written publication, it's a video, or it's an audio. At some level, this stuff arises in very trivial matters. It tends to arise, and virtually almost always arises, in Commonwealth countries, or at least outside of the United States. The basis is privacy, that there is some story that a journalist has, the publication of which will somehow invade in a way that is deeply problematic, the privacy of some person. A person is almost always a celebrity. Again a lot of times when this comes up it seems trivial um so there was for example a football player or soccer player as people in England would call him that's fellow on the right there and he was kevin gigs griggs and he Was having a prominent player at some team. He was having an affair with that young woman who was a reality tv star and he went in and said look you can't publish this story because if you do you'll destroy my marriage Putting aside the question of the reason his marriage might have been in jeopardy was the fact he was having an affair with a reality TV star. Anyway, that injunction was put in place, and not only was there an injunction against publication of that story, but they sought an injunction against the report that there was an injunction. So it was called a super injunction. So not only can you report the fact that these two are having an affair, you can't report the fact that you're barred from reporting a story based on Mr Griggs. And that injunction served for some period of time. Another prominent case was, this is Sir Elton John and his husband, Mr. Furness, David Furnes. And there was a story that they sought to block the publication of in English court. In this case, there was actually extensive coverage of Mr.Furness' menage à trois with another married couple. And it was reported in the United States, it was recorded in Canada, it was report in other countries. It just wasn't reported in England because a judge, in this case, this fellow, entered an injunction saying, well, that would be a terrible thing for the children of this couple to hear about because they've sworn loyalty to each other. Again, ignoring the fact that Mr. Furness appears unquestionably to have had this liaison with this couple. And that injunction stayed in place until a member of Parliament stood up and said, yo, folks, there are 75,000 Britons tweeting and retweeting these stories as published outside of the United Kingdom. Why can't we just run the stories about it? It may not be what people want to read, but leave that up to them. And because he announced the name of the couple on the floor of Parliament, that story was published. 'And again, this is all celebrity tittle-tattle and you know, whatever. And one can get more or less exorcised about it, but where Super Injunctions came from in the United Kingdom was a case involving this company, which has $1.5 billion in revenue most recently, $3 billion in profit. It's a trading company. They specialize in commodities and other forms of trade. In 2000s, they had a business in which they would dump basically toxic waste on the coast of Africa. And they would just dump it, they would buy it or take responsibility for it in the United Kingdom. And they just dumped it. And there was a report on this and the company Trafagura went in and got an injunction against the Guardian reporting on that business of theirs. And the consequences. And also on the report, a government report prepared, a Milton report is what it's called, the Guardian's report of that report so that no one would know what was going on, no one know it had been executed by the government, and no one wouldn't know that the traffic or a company had gotten in junction against the Guardian. That one lasted for about five weeks and then finally, again, a member of parliament said, look I'm going to get on the of parliament when there's privilege. And I'm going to announce this trafficker are doing this. And that collapsed the case. But until then, in the United Kingdom, this very prominent company could not be reported on by the English press because of this, in my mind, somewhat bizarre order. And that's what you get into these orders. More recently, in this case discussed in the textbook, there's a case involving Bloomberg where A fellow whose name isn't used, who is the subject of a criminal investigation involving multiple countries and is under investigation for engaging in illegal activity in developing world markets, countries. There's a part of that investigation. There is a request for information from the UK investigator and criminal investigator to another country for information about transactions that have occurred on this felon's responsibility or relationship to them. And again, there's a story published. And after that, the individual goes to the courts of another felon, it's not this exact guy, but looks a lot like him. Once you put somebody in a full body wig thing, they all kind of look like this. And said, look, you can't allow the publication of the story because I'm just being investigated. It's a terrible thing. I'll be acquitted. In the meantime, the fact that government is expending resource and looking for information is a matter of private concern to me, despite the presence and commitment of government resources. And that argument prevails. That argument prevails at trial. That argument is at trial court. That argument prevails at the Court of Appeal. And at the moment, Bloomberg News is prevented from reporting on this story or writing more about information it plainly has in its possession. And that's the concern about these injunctions and super injunctions. Because there's information that's available to the press. The press has not stolen the information. It's not promoted in some way. It has the information, has the story, and it's barred from publishing it. So if someone says they want a gag order, they want an injunction against you as a journalist, serious matter. You should take it seriously. Make sure your editors know and almost surely talk to a lawyer. Anyway, a scary area of the law and something that my hope is you will never be exposed to. Thank you. Hi. I just wanted to talk briefly about why it matters who has the burden of proof on the issue of falsity in defamation cases. This is one of the elements of defamation. In the United States, it is the plaintiff who has to prove the statement that the plaintive alleged is defamatory. That has to prove it false. In the United Kingdom, England, Wales, and actually much of the world outside the United States, it's the defense job actually to prove a statement that is published true. That that's considered to be an appropriate burden to put on a defendant because, after all, they were supposed to have checked the statement before it was published, and therefore the defendant should be satisfied that, in fact, the statement is true before it publishes it. 'Here's the consequence of that. So this is the High Court of England and Wales in London on the Strand. And we can talk about it in the context of a specific case, and that's there are two lawsuits pending in this world. There may be more, but there are at least two pending between John C. Depp, also known as Johnny Depp and his ex-wife Amber Heard involving defamation. In both those cases, Johnny Depp has sued Amber Heard, or for someone who quoted Amber Heard, and the burden of proof may very well decide the outcome in those cases. So in England and Wales, in this court, there was a trial this past summer, where Johnny Depp had sued the Sun newspaper, which had alleged, stated pretty clearly, that Johnny Depp had assaulted his wife while they were married. And Johnny Depp sued for defamation, saying, I never did. And basically, because he filed the case because he was the plaintiff, the court accepts as a starting point, as a matter of law, in that system. That the statement is false because Johnny Depp said it was false. And therefore, to defend the case, on this specific point of falsity, the Sun newspaper had to prove it's true. So Johnny Depp spent five days on the witness stand talking about largely about the impact that all this had on him and to some extent what had happened. And then Amber Heard spent four days as a witness on behalf of the Sun, testifying about what Johnny Depp had done to her. And I read the testimony. There's a bit of a discussion of this in the materials. But the judge will decide sometime this fall as to who prevailed in that case, and it will almost certainly all come down to the question of truth. Did the Sun newspaper in defending this case prove it true that Johnny Depp had assaulted his wife? 'This is the trial court, state court, in Fairfax County, Virginia. And Johnny Depp, also sued, and this time directly to Amber Heard, over an editorial or an op-ed she wrote for the Washington Post. Again, stating basically that she became famous because she became a symbol or a spokesperson for partners who had been assaulted in their marriage. 'And while she didn't name Johnny Depp, Johnny Debb sued, he was in fact her only ex-husband, and therefore sued again for defamation. But because in this case he filed the United States against Amber Heard, in this case he will have to prove the statement false. Thank you for watching! The problem, really, is if you have the burden of proving it, proving something, it really means you have to put together all the evidence, and you have to persuade a judge or a jury that, in fact, your version of events is the correct one, whether that's because Johnny Depp is able to prove something false, or the Sun newspaper is able prove it true in England. 'And having that burden approved means it's got to come down to something more than the heads or tabs, and that's an English pound. And if it just comes down to it could be true, it could not be true. Well, whoever had the burden of proof there is going to lose. It has to be more than a 50-50 shot. They have to persuade you. And by getting that burden of proof in England, particularly for the journalist, it means it's just a bit more likely, and potentially a lot more likely that the journalist will lose the case. 'What that's led to in the English media system is that Typically, the last person to read a story before it's really set and printed or distributed over the internet is what's called a night lawyer, which tends to be the least junior lawyer at whatever law firm is handling this work or in-house lawyer that's handling the work, because it tends to at night, and it tends be someone who therefore doesn't necessarily have that much experience. And what that person's job is, is to remove from the publication, so from each story or the story in its entirety, Anything that that lawyer thinks, well, we can't prove this true in court, because that's going to be the standard that's going matter if they get sued. In a U.S. System, because the issue really is for the plaintiff to prove the statement false, there's a lot more comfort from the litigation side, from the protection side, from a journalist taking risks side, because putting a negative actually kind of hard to do. Because it's not, especially when you look at truth as a question of what's the gist of what you're trying to say, it doesn't have to be an absolute truth. It just has to be more likely than not that it's true, or not more likely than not, that it is false. And if you think Think about this in context of what we'll say, think about how... Easy it is to prove that at least something might have happened or could have happened, probably did happen, as opposed to proving that this absolutely did not happen. So there are, for example, with Johnny Depp, there are pictures out there of Amber Heard with injuries to her face. His allegation is that she did those herself to set him up, and there's a whole thing going on there. I don't in any way comment on the merits of anybody's position, but ... There are pictures of Amber Heard with injuries to her face. He's going to have to prove that those are not evidence of abuse. In the United Kingdom, because they're trying to prove it true, that in fact he did abuse his wife, they'll have to show what those pictures actually meant. They're going to show how they were taken, where they were, all that. And they're going have the burden of persuasion. And just that switch makes it just far more likely that a journalist will lose a lawsuit in the UK than the journalist would lose the exact same case on the exact the same issue in the United States. I wanted to bring some friends along to wish you a happy birthday. We have we have Lee Kuan Yew whose memoirs We both had to read because he kept suing everyone. We had mr. Kaczynski who led to the purchase of the wax bust of Lenin. We had Mr. Jamil who was kind enough to visit in London, but nonetheless led with the purchase some good Polish vodka the House of Lords. We had Mr. Gutnick, another frenemy, who was insistent upon us going to Victoria. And we had Mr Gopal, a judge, Gopel Swee Ram, who brought us all to Malaysia. But in a time of COVID and lockdown, I just wanted to remind you of all the things we've been able to do around the world. And as always to thank you, because at Dow Jones, at the Wall Street Journal. Knowing that you were there to defend us made us both braver and better. So I hope you have a great birthday and I hope soon enough we can end up being in the same place and have a glass to toast it. Take care.
