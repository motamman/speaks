00:05:50.760,00:06:16.519,00:00:25.759,"So we have to pick something to cover in 45 minutes. So we thought we'd talk about privacy, because you're all being photographed, so what the hell? Abuse wherever, but the idea is to talk about and focus on the differences between the U.S. System and the European, and in particular an area of privacy that Europe just had its first case, which involves both privacy and news gathering.",Stuart,edited
00:06:17.080,00:06:49.730,00:00:32.650,"And in this case, it was the use of hidden cameras, hidden microphones. John, in his life, particularly focusing on television, is one of the U.S.'s most experienced lawyers in dealing with this, and is not necessarily the beginning, but perhaps the end of that process, and how both courts and news reacted. But Mark, maybe start from the proposition of this case, Haldeman, versus Switzerland, sort of what happened there, and then maybe we can talk about sort of how it's different and what the approach and what significance of that is.",Stuart,edited
00:06:50.380,00:10:54.760,00:04:04.380,"'Well there were four Swiss journalists, TV journalists, excuse me, frog in my throat, who worked for the rather snappily named Swiss TV program, Kassen Sturz. And they had got approval from their editors to do some hidden camera filming. There had been problems with insurance brokers giving. What might best be described as sub-optimal advice. And so basically, they wanted to be able to get the evidence of this. And they put cameras in a room, the court came to the conclusion that A, that there was low quality advice being given, two, that the insurance broker had a reasonable expectation of privacy, That's the touchstone test that we have that he had a reasonable expectation of privacy and also reasonable expectation that the information that he imparted would not be amplified through electronic media or any other way. And they noted a rather interesting point which was that the journalists having reviewed the material after they'd recorded it had only used the really bad stuff. Which showed, in their view, the high public interest. So by not showing lots and lots of material and limiting it to the really bad stuff, that was a greater justification for the intrusion into his privacy. And the conclusion that they came to was that the broker had a private life. He was entitled to protection of that. He had an expectation of it. But in this particular. Set of circumstances, the public interest trumped his right to privacy. And so there was the right for the journalists to speak. Now this is quite important because the essential fact that I haven't told you is that there is a complete statutory bar on doing any hidden camera recording at all in Switzerland. What the European Court of Human Rights have done is effectively put a gloss on a complete blanket statutory ban and said, yeah, you can have a statutory ban, but you've got to be able to be flexible enough to take where it's appropriate the opportunity to have a public interest defense. And part of that was that we put forward a series of programs which we had taken in the UK or had been made in the U.K., which where there isn't a statutory ban. And so we had things like a Channel 4 program about the abuse of corpses at funeral parlors. We did one about the abusive animals at dogs' homes and things like that. And of course, there's nothing worse to an English person than abuse of their dog, as you will have seen in Downton recently, I'm sure. Or if not, you've got that coming. Sorry, a spoiler, yeah. The worst, of course was the program that was made about the abuse of disabled folk, some... Mentally disabled some, physically disabled some both, who were physically and otherwise abused by their carers. And I think that that gave the court a very clear understanding of the utility of public.",Mark,edited
00:10:55.710,00:11:19.169,00:00:23.459,"'But England doesn't have an absolute bar against hidden cameras and microphones. But so John, I mean, we talked earlier today about a couple cases which actually, and again, these go, this is the first case to the European Court of Human Rights on the issue of the hidden camera, hidden microphone. There's a history of this in the United States which is long, tortured, complicated, and has made John, not a wealthy man, but a well-employed man for a number of decades.",Stuart,not-edited
00:11:20.130,00:11:21.070,00:00:00.940,'And a well-informed man.,Mark,not-edited
00:11:22.030,00:13:46.450,00:02:24.420,"So that's not clear. First, could I ask, could the lights be turned down a little bit so this feels more like a conversation, less like an interrogation? Thank you. Thank you very much. And I would just like, and I see several of my students in here, so they know that this approach, taken in this British case, or the Swiss case, before the European Court, is very different from the way American courts have treated news gathering issues like this, like trespass, like use of hidden cameras, like serve justice recording. Because American courts has said, it is not a defense, if you violate the law I'll commit a tort. The news gathering tactic that you use, the newsworthiness of your report is not a defense. They're not going to balance it. So, and a dramatic example of that in California some years ago, Group W productions for a series on EMS workers. Did some recording, they put recording device on EMS workers and Oh, sorry, okay. And one of them went and tended to a woman who had been trapped under a car off the highway and recorded conversation with her as she was trapped in the car and then later as they flew off in a helicopter to a hospital. They never showed that woman's face. They never identified her by name, but she did recognize herself by voice and by circumstance. And she sued for two things. She sued for invasion of privacy, for the broadcast of embarrassing private facts about her, and for intrusion for the secret recording. And the same court, the California Supreme Court, held that no, she lost on the invasion of privacy for private facts because this was a legitimately newsworthy matter they were covering, the operations of healthcare workers. But the court ruled in her favor and said she could pursue a claim for intrusion. The news gathering was separate. So the newsworthiness did not rescue the group W from the tort for the intrusion, and that's a different approach. Do you expect this to be carried over throughout Europe?",John,not-edited
00:13:46.740,00:15:40.659,00:01:53.919,"Yeah, I mean it goes beyond just Switzerland because of course it's in the European Court of Human Rights and that applies to countries as diverse as Russia and Turkey and all the sort of rather odd countries who are not even in the EU, so think European Union plus all the bits around the edges and you've got a major change in the law and approach in every single one of these countries. And I think... So, you know, you're still going to have to show that you thought about, first of all, that it was necessary to reveal serious wrongdoing or criminality. So you're going to to have thought that going in, so you'll have to have had a good tip or some information which would lead you to that conclusion. You'll have get senior editorial approval, who will then have to document why they made that approval. Then you will have the secret camera recording, and then reviewing that, there's a second decision to be made about whether or not you're going to further intrude beyond the secret recording, because obviously that's a, if you like, a smaller invasion of privacy than to amplify that through the general broadcast to the world at large. And so, Those are the sorts of, and that's the decision tree that we have to make and we have justify. But it's incredibly good if you go back to, oh there was a woman who, an American journalist who impersonated herself into a mental institution in New York, centuries ago I think. And effectively it's the same kind of case and test. There's a real understanding that you can get through this. No, we have done...",Mark,not-edited
00:15:40.730,00:15:58.150,00:00:17.420,"Right, so this guy's right to privacy applies even though he was an insurance broker, the journalist posed as someone seeking insurance. They met in a rented space of some sort, like a hotel room. So it's classic in a sense, consumer reporting in that sense.",Stuart,edited
00:15:58.490,00:16:23.670,00:00:25.180,"And so here, because of the fact that the news worthiness does not trump the intrusion because of that secret recording. There was a case, we talked about this one earlier, Desnick, which was an ophthalmologist, and there, that report was, which you could just discuss a little bit, but that report protected, but as a result of a change in the law, no longer occurs.",Stuart,edited
00:16:24.370,00:17:39.970,00:01:15.600,"Yeah, that was an ABC News piece that sent in some of the hidden cameras to a clinic that had been accused of doing unnecessary and actually dangerous surgeries on patients' eyes. And ABC sent in some patients for whom actually this surgery would be not only unnecessary, but dangerous. And yes, it was recommended to them anyway, and they captured that interaction on hidden camera. The clinic sued ABC, in ABC. One, because, among other things, that kind of hidden camera was lawful in Illinois at that time. As Stuart mentioned, though, today there was later a change in Illinois law, and under Illinois law now recording of private conversations is the audio that's at issue, but the recording would be illegal. So when someone would come to me now and say, oh, we want to do a piece about ophthalmologists and unnecessary surgeries. And we want to capture that conversation, and we're looking at Illinois, I would have to say, despite the newsworthiness and importance of the reporting, we better look at some other states, because we can't capture that interaction.",John,not-edited
00:17:40.930,00:18:14.079,00:00:33.149,"'I mean, it's quite interesting that, you know, that's a problem, because the news-gathering process isn't a problem. I mean you know invariably within, well not invariably, but very often within camera there is that impersonation element that you refer to Stuart in the sense that you know you go in and you pretend to be someone and you know it's a, we have a situation where other programs. I mean, I was thinking particularly of the Food Lion case over here where, you of Sarah O'Rourke.",Mark,not-edited
00:18:14.440,00:18:16.420,00:00:01.980,"Also ABC. Also ABC, how does this happen?",John,not-edited
00:18:16.970,00:18:56.410,00:00:39.440,"Food line were basically, as I understand it, cutting the green bits off out of date meat, repackaging it, and putting it back on the shelves. So you had somebody go in. And that's perfectly possible for us. I mean, we have to be able to show that the individual reporter hasn't gained. So the money that they're paid as a worker has to go into a trust account and has to back afterwards. But basically, that's... Perfectly cool as far as we're concerned. I've always been gobsmacked at that decision but it's always down to that distinction that you have which we just don't.",Mark,not-edited
00:18:57.730,00:19:07.250,00:00:09.520,"Well, but ultimately Foodland ABC did win. Oh, did you? Oh, I didn't, for two dollars. We won almost everything. We ended up paying two dollars...",John,not-edited
00:19:08.240,00:19:09.140,00:00:00.900,So the honor was satisfied.,Mark,not-edited
00:19:09.170,00:19:11.349,00:00:02.179,On a minor trespassing.,John,not-edited
00:19:12.410,00:19:54.950,00:00:42.540,"Well, I mean, I think it's interesting you raise that, because one of the things that happened, because the first time I became cognizant of sort of the news gathering talks that you have here, the attack on news gathering by attacking the actual processes, was in Food Lion and when that was going on, and I predicted it would happen in the UK, and it hasn't. It's taken until basically the last 18 months to begin a process of that, and so. We're now seeing claims in trespass, in harassment, in order to try and preclude the gathering of information. But you don't.",Mark,not-edited
00:19:56.270,00:20:08.710,00:00:12.440,"That this sort of approach, that the newsworthiness, the importance of the reporting, will trump the news gathering toward, or crime? Would that even extend to a physical trespass?",John,not-edited
00:20:08.740,00:21:36.460,00:01:27.720,"Yeah, I mean, I think the courts are basically going to say, well, you know, you walked on someone's front lawn in order to get pictures of wrongdoing. A couple of broken blades of glass, that doesn't warrant any money. Similarly, I can see situations where people are using drones to fly over without anybody's knowledge and effectively trespassing in the airspace. And I think that that again is going to be dealt with as an invasion of privacy. In fact, you know, our celebrities now expect it, so if you're buying Hello or Okay, and I know that there's some of you out there that are addicted, I can see you are, madam. And they, it's all our little guilty secret, I am too. And, but now when they sell the weddings and things, the car pulls up into a tent. The flaps are let down and everybody walks in under a covered walkway because, you know, there's so many drones around and all the rest of it. And I was talking to a friend of mine, Amal Clooney, who was getting married in Venice a little while ago. And she said she had no idea until she saw the pictures that there were drones all over the Grand Canal taking pictures of her going to and from the wedding and wedding reception. Well, drone use.",Mark,not-edited
00:21:36.490,00:21:46.790,00:00:10.300,"By journalists has proceeded more quickly than in the US, where it's been held back here by the FAA. But across Europe and most of the world, it is just flourishing freely, right?",John,not-edited
00:21:47.240,00:22:59.740,00:01:12.500,"Yeah, no, it's amazingly good fun because we, but perfectly happily, you don't even need to be qualified. Anything that weighs up to 22 kilos, and that's basically the size of my wife's luggage when she checks in. It's really big. And that's the sort of size of something falling out of the sky. And that, you do need to qualified for that. Now, of course. The BBC, being the BBC have got someone who's a former aviation pilot, who's got a proper license and all the rest of it, and they notify people and they do everything very properly, but this prevention which you have, which is that if you're the person who took the film or the journalist who uses it does it for commercial gain, then it suddenly becomes illegal and problematic. We just don't have that issue. So if you want to go take drone pictures, off you go. And the only preventative issue is really privacy. Is there an invasion of privacy? Do you have a legitimate expectation?",Mark,not-edited
00:22:59.530,00:23:30.069,00:00:30.539,"Right, because the oddity about Haldeman and the secret camera is that the Europeans sue for privacy much more, especially minor royals in money laundering countries. And they tend to prevail at least for some period of time, or they stand outside wearing either not the top and not the bottom, or not both, and tend to be members of the royal family in England. And they sue and they win, they get some sort of money.",Stuart,edited
00:23:30.130,00:23:56.849,00:00:26.719,"So there's this protection of privacy, which is really quite surprising, if you look at it from an American perspective. And yet on something like this, which is American jurisprudence has no problem basically punishing the hidden microphone in the ambulance and wouldn't look at news worthiness. In fact, it goes the other way there and it's more, you can do more there than you can here. Really quite extraordinary. I'm not sure it's rational. I'm sure which is the better system, but it's different.",Stuart,edited
00:23:57.040,00:24:51.749,00:00:54.709,"Yeah, you can gather anything you want. The question is, can you exploit it? And, you know, so you have... So walk through that. Well, let's take a situation which I had to deal with was some drone pilots decided that Paris Hilton was of interest, and she was doing, she was on the Cote d'Azur. Topless, as everybody on the Côte d'Azur is, and they got the shots of her and then the question. With a dron. And the question was, you know, how do you deal with that? We have similar issues, I mean. So how did you deal that? Well, we just published. I mean, you, I, I. I mean they, she had a. Did you do a legal analysis, or you just wrote that down?",Mark,not-edited
00:24:51.390,00:24:52.630,00:00:01.240,"Yeah, yeah, well, yeah what?",Speaker 5,not-edited
00:24:54.190,00:25:12.970,00:00:18.780,"There were two things, really. Where would we be sued? And so clearly, she could sue us in France, but the French are very keen on these legal actions, but they don't actually think much about the term in terms of damages. She could have sued us in London.",Mark,not-edited
00:25:13.230,00:25:16.890,00:00:03.660,"Dutch is cake up with like 15,000 including, sorry.",Stuart,not-edited
00:25:17.090,00:25:47.559,00:00:30.469,"Yeah, and you know, if you think about the intrusion for the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate, she, and that was at the topless pictures, so they were taken at a chateau in France, which has a long tradition of history with the royal family, I'll tell you about that in a minute, but the image was on every national newspaper, it was all over the world, closer went to about four or five reprints. As a consequence of it.",Mark,not-edited
00:25:47.160,00:25:49.359,00:00:02.199,There's the French magazine that I actually published in.,Stuart,not-edited
00:25:49.390,00:26:52.839,00:01:03.449,"Yeah, absolutely, and so there was a lot of intrusions. So 15,000 euros is not a lot of money for that, and of course, you know, they've had more in terms of profit. I mean, they've probably made a couple of hundred thousand on the back of that. So the economics of that are not a disincentive. The English have taken a slightly different approach in the sense that we do give seriously large awards for damages. So. For the phone hacking, which we've had recently. The Daily Mirror has rather foolishly in my judgment taken all of these cases to court and the judges cannot restrain themselves. So the awards have been sort of 150,000, 250,000 pounds. Pounds, yeah. Yeah, and it's important to just put that in context. So we don't have jury awards or indeed the awards like Stewart lost 240 million.",Mark,not-edited
00:26:52.980,00:26:53.440,00:00:00.460,And won.,Stuart,not-edited
00:26:53.690,00:30:41.940,00:03:48.250,"And won, and won, yes, I appreciate you. You know, you did well afterwards. Second time out. We're all great affiliate lawyers. Yeah. But the important thing to remember is that if you lose the site in one eye in the UK, we've got a kind of tariff for it. We actually have a book with all the things in. So it's about 10 to 15,000 pounds for the loss of an eye, permanent loss of vision. If you, and part of the rationale for that is that you've got another one. And similarly, losing the forearm below the elbow, so somewhere around here, that's going to be, again, about 10 to 15,000 pounds. So personally, I would prefer to be photographed from the top off and publicly humiliated than to have that physical difference. But that is the difference. And in terms of libel, we have a cap on libel of 230,000 lbs. So if I call John a pedophile murderer on the front page of every national newspaper, that's the maximum that he can get in terms of damages. So privacy awards have kind of got out beyond them. But going back to the chateau in France, the infamous Royal Chateau, which is rented out to, or lent to. Members of the royal family. Charles used to go there with Camilla when he was still married to Diana for their summer holiday, so they'd go away for a month and, well, be together. And one of my clients was a photographer who discovered where they went, and so he went down and took a photograph of Charles getting changed through... The bedroom window in the evening as the sun was going down. And fortunately for Charles, unfortunately for the photographer, the sun, was on the window at the time and the photographer didn't have a UV filter for the lens which was that long and about that wide. And so, there was this sort of, well sort of a glow around the crown jewels and so anyway he was not content with this photograph. The Germans published that wasn't it, in Bill? The next year he goes back, this year he's bought, you know, £6.95, a UV filter that will fit over this thing and he gets the shot which demonstrates that A, the moil has been round and B, that the... You know, you see the full Crown Jewels and all the rest of it. And he has the problem. Not a privacy problem, you might think. The problem is that nobody will publish it, because it's too rude. Except, of course, the Italians. It's always the Italians, isn't it? Well, the Italian's came up with a rather ingenious solution, and what they did was they put Um put it on the front cover of a magazine, and put a black box over the crown jewels, and on the black box it said, for the full uncensored image, take a two euro coin and scratch off, and you've got all these Italian matrons scratching away, which I thought was genius, It's an evil genius, but genius nonetheless.",Mark,not-edited
00:30:44.050,00:31:04.509,00:00:20.459,"Okay, so that's one aspect of privacy. Or not, always change indoors, it's a reminder. But then other aspects of privacy and a difference with the U.S. would be what's commonly known as the right to be forgotten. Which is actually the right to be harder to find or the right to be obscure and if I can find this.",Stuart,edited
00:31:05.670,00:31:28.839,00:00:23.169,"Ah, there it is. So this is the thing, right? Yeah, this is what we're all concerned with. Right, so what this is not about, I'll start with that and you can say what it's about. It's not about this is the original notice that reports this guy has a financial problem. Yeah, and that's on their website and it's not taking down off their website. This is about something different. What's this about?",Stuart,edited
00:31:29.290,00:31:38.710,00:00:09.420,"So, this is the actual print edition of La Vanguardia and under Spanish law, when you had... This, by the way...",Mark,not-edited

He'd moved on with his life. And he was now a successful lawyer. Um, and, uh, no longer a property dealer and so on and so forth. And so he took this case on the right to be forgotten. Now, this is a form of privacy law that we have.

Now, he tried, he initially started proceedings against La Vanguardia and Google, but dropped the case against LaVanguardia very quickly because he recognized that there's a defense, which is that journalists are entitled to keep. Material in their archives for journalistic purposes. So, La Vanguardia are in the clear. But Google is merely a search engine according to the European Court. And as a commercial search engine, they are obliged to process data. That is, they're supposed to behave appropriately in relation to data. And they don't get the journalistic exemption. So, anyone. Who doesn't like a story about themselves or believes it falls into the categories can now apply to have it removed or effectively airbrushed from history because you are de-linked. The right to be forgotten is quite an emotive term, but basically it's de-linking. So it's like going, I think it's a bit like going into a library and leaving the book on the shelf.

For the Grand Prix racing and he decided to entertain four or five prostitutes in a Chelsea basement and one of the prostitues had what's well that well-known news gathering article a bra cam and she sold the story to News of the World and they publish it all over the front page. He sued for libel in Germany, and he sued for invasion of privacy in the UK. His libel theory was, because the News of the World's headline was Nazi orgy, and so basically his theory was that this was a commonel garden British orgy. And he was entitled to the extra diminution in value and loss of reputation for it actually being wrongly identified as a Nazi orgy. So if we just said on the headline, good British orgy in Chelsea, presumably he wouldn't have got any libel damages. Anyway, he won his privacy case and set the bar for damages at about 60,000 then, but they've gone way up from there. There's no jury, they're all being set by judges, and judges are finding very fact-specifically ways of getting at higher awards. So they're starting to break down the wrongs, the torts. They're starting say, well, you effectively looked at somebody's private material on several different occasions, so I'm gonna give you the maximum award each time, so we're gonna total them up. Okay, well, they went into your phone records, we'll give you 50,000 every time they did it. So four or six times they did, that starts to get to be a meaningful, sensible number.

Yeah, and I think part of that is, of course, we have to remember that although we bequeath the legal system to you, we don't have a constitution. You have a Constitution, you have a Bill of Rights, all of which are meaningful and have an effect on the way in which your law is interpreted and actually allows people. To speak openly and freely and all the rest of it. And we have this rather peculiar situation where we've never thought that people should have the right to speak freely and so our libel laws are very claimant friendly. They're, even now, I would think 90% of cases are run, won by claimants. So it really is, I mean that's why it's called the libel capital of the world because you basically have to be a moron in a hurry to lose a case there. And then of course what's happened is as we've joined the EU and also we signed up to the European Convention on Human Rights, increasingly these continental notions and the case law from the continent about privacy have come forward. So. You know, the sort of ideas that sort of emerge from France, but many of the other countries where the president can have four or five mistresses, but not a single newspaper will report it because of their privacy laws. Those kinds of laws are coming in, you know up our rivers into our estuaries and into the streams. And that really is affecting the way in which the legal system.

In Australia this month, I think, did the same of removing a defamation link. You're sort of seeing the Commonwealth countries draw ranks to punch holes in Google.

00:51:08.720,00:54:48.730,00:03:40.010,"I think it's a very pertinent question and I'm glad you asked it, thank you. What I do is I start off by looking at what would we be doing if this was a company selling widgets or undertaking some business abroad and you look at whether they've got a business in the country that you're doing business in. Are they selling products there? What is the structure that you're looking at? And invariably, it's difficult to get jurisdiction over somebody who's not there or jurisdiction over somebody who is it's merely a subsidiary. And what the continentals are doing particularly is attacking these tech companies through their subsidiaries. I think is just jurisprudentially wrong, but it is what they're doing. And I think it's setting very bad precedents because there are, when you play this back the other way, so let's say Iran decides to start making judgments against or take something somewhere that's slightly less controversial, Turkey, which has a big sort of clothes industry and other kinds of industry, you start playing those back the way and you want to have proceedings brought, but you have deliberately set up a subsidiary in Turkey, which has very limited scope. All the decisions are actually made back in London or New York, it doesn't much matter. Then in those circumstances, that corporate structure should be respected. The laws the world over have been designed to respect that corporate structures. And what we've got here is a situation where they're not respecting the corporate structure and I think that is the problem. They're not playing by the rules anymore and that's going to set really bad precedence in just trade areas, irrespective of the ICT parts of it. And I think they're looking at saying, well, you know, these people can effectively broadcast into our jurisdictions or they can communicate into our jurisdiction and Therefore, we should be able to do something about that. Just take that one stage further. You know, the Turks don't like it if you say rude things about Atatürk. You know he's a national symbol. And effectively, they've attacked YouTube and other online spaces where those individuals have said things about Ataturk which are not entirely praising. And I think we're starting to erode at this notion of individual rights and all the rest of it. And that's why I made the point. In Spain, it was an advertising sales office. That's all it did. The data wasn't even held in Ireland. There was no data held in Spain. No executive, no employee had the power to do anything in Spain and it's only people at the head office in California that have the power to do everything. So what is happening is that there is an abuse. The legal construct that we have devised for centuries of the corporation.",Mark,not-edited
00:54:49.320,00:55:07.079,00:00:17.759,And that those countries were fully participant in. They wanted to get the local office because they wanted people to basically advertise. They wanted people market globally. And so what they're doing is they're sacrificing that participation potentially at the altar of this fetishization of these issues. There's nothing about this that's inaccurate.,Stuart,edited

And the question is, at what point does the cost get so high for the Googles that they simply say, you come to California and contract with us, because we're not going to bother. We're not going have Google France. Or Google France will actually be run out of servers in California. You can do that easily enough.",Stuart,edited

You've obviously got this tension now between undercover reporting and this public interest test, and then the idea of trespass. I was wondering if you think you're going to start seeing public interest coming in as almost an excuse to trespass in these situations, and whether you could then see that extending to things like theft and surveillance in terms of voicemails and phone hacking.",Speaker 7,not-edited
00:56:23.450,00:58:39.160,00:02:15.710,"That's a very good question. In fact, I had a case over the last six weeks where the target went to criminal lawyers to advise. And what they did was that they laid a trap. So, when the journalists went round to the office... By appointment to interview senior executives for the article, they had slipped onto the signing in book key documents which were relevant to the story. And we managed to get hold of the video footage of them actually putting them there. And of course the journalist did what any of your journalists would do was picked them up and took them off to read them. There was no intention to permanently deprive, no intention steal them, but obviously want to take them away, look at them more carefully. And so what they were trying to do was then prosecute and criminalize the journalists through theft. And that was what the game, the game that that was afoot. So we are seeing people really starting to push the boundaries on these things and attack in a very aggressive way. The news gathering side of things. But I think we are going to see increasing problems with news gathering. Because of course when, as it is the case in Australia at the moment, they don't have privacy laws like we have, like the UK used to be before the continentals infected us with their privacy. Then in those circumstances, you can still do long lens photography, you can still... Pat people, you can still do all of that stuff there. And that, I think, is quite an interesting tension because you're gonna find this patchwork around the world when some countries where you can do these things and some countries when you can't.
