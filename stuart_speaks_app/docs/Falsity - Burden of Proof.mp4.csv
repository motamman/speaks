00:00:00.600,00:00:09.119,00:00:08.519,Hi. I just wanted to talk briefly about why it matters who has the burden of proof on the issue of falsity in defamation cases. This is one of the elements of defamation.,Stuart,not-edited
00:00:10.140,00:00:28.280,00:00:18.140,"In the United States, it is the plaintiff who has to prove the statement that the plaintive alleged is defamatory. That has to prove it false. In the United Kingdom, England, Wales, and actually much of the world outside the United States, it's the defense job actually to prove a statement that is published true.",Stuart,edited
00:00:28.800,00:00:43.039,00:00:14.239,"That that's considered to be an appropriate burden to put on a defendant because, after all, they were supposed to have checked the statement before it was published, and therefore the defendant should be satisfied that, in fact, the statement is true before it publishes it.",Stuart,edited
00:00:44.020,00:01:05.539,00:00:21.519,"'Here's the consequence of that. So this is the High Court of England and Wales in London on the Strand. And we can talk about it in the context of a specific case, and that's there are two lawsuits pending in this world. There may be more, but there are at least two pending between John C. Depp, also known as Johnny Depp and his ex-wife Amber Heard involving defamation.",Stuart,edited
00:01:06.020,00:01:37.340,00:00:31.320,"In both those cases, Johnny Depp has sued Amber Heard, or for someone who quoted Amber Heard, and the burden of proof may very well decide the outcome in those cases. So in England and Wales, in this court, there was a trial this past summer, where Johnny Depp had sued the Sun newspaper, which had alleged, stated pretty clearly, that Johnny Depp had assaulted his wife while they were married. And Johnny Depp sued for defamation, saying, I never did.",Stuart,edited
00:01:38.140,00:01:56.840,00:00:18.700,"And basically, because he filed the case because he was the plaintiff, the court accepts as a starting point, as a matter of law, in that system. That the statement is false because Johnny Depp said it was false. And therefore, to defend the case, on this specific point of falsity, the Sun newspaper had to prove it's true.",Stuart,edited
00:01:57.680,00:02:13.420,00:00:15.740,"So Johnny Depp spent five days on the witness stand talking about largely about the impact that all this had on him and to some extent what had happened. And then Amber Heard spent four days as a witness on behalf of the Sun, testifying about what Johnny Depp had done to her. And I read the testimony.",Stuart,edited
00:02:13.620,00:02:30.509,00:00:16.889,"There's a bit of a discussion of this in the materials. But the judge will decide sometime this fall as to who prevailed in that case, and it will almost certainly all come down to the question of truth. Did the Sun newspaper in defending this case prove it true that Johnny Depp had assaulted his wife?",Stuart,edited
00:02:32.430,00:02:55.110,00:00:22.680,"'This is the trial court, state court, in Fairfax County, Virginia. And Johnny Depp, also sued, and this time directly to Amber Heard, over an editorial or an op-ed she wrote for the Washington Post. Again, stating basically that she became famous because she became a symbol or a spokesperson for partners who had been assaulted in their marriage.",Stuart,edited
00:02:55.930,00:03:11.750,00:00:15.820,"'And while she didn't name Johnny Depp, Johnny Debb sued, he was in fact her only ex-husband, and therefore sued again for defamation. But because in this case he filed the United States against Amber Heard, in this case he will have to prove the statement false. Thank you for watching!",Stuart,edited
00:03:12.560,00:03:31.000,00:00:18.440,"The problem, really, is if you have the burden of proving it, proving something, it really means you have to put together all the evidence, and you have to persuade a judge or a jury that, in fact, your version of events is the correct one, whether that's because Johnny Depp is able to prove something false, or the Sun newspaper is able prove it true in England.",Stuart,edited
00:03:32.040,00:03:59.489,00:00:27.449,"'And having that burden approved means it's got to come down to something more than the heads or tabs, and that's an English pound. And if it just comes down to it could be true, it could not be true. Well, whoever had the burden of proof there is going to lose. It has to be more than a 50-50 shot. They have to persuade you. And by getting that burden of proof in England, particularly for the journalist, it means it's just a bit more likely, and potentially a lot more likely that the journalist will lose the case.",Stuart,edited
00:04:00.130,00:04:25.669,00:00:25.539,"'What that's led to in the English media system is that Typically, the last person to read a story before it's really set and printed or distributed over the internet is what's called a night lawyer, which tends to be the least junior lawyer at whatever law firm is handling this work or in-house lawyer that's handling the work, because it tends to at night, and it tends be someone who therefore doesn't necessarily have that much experience.",Stuart,edited
00:04:25.930,00:04:39.579,00:00:13.649,"And what that person's job is, is to remove from the publication, so from each story or the story in its entirety, Anything that that lawyer thinks, well, we can't prove this true in court, because that's going to be the standard that's going matter if they get sued.",Stuart,edited
00:04:40.180,00:04:55.220,00:00:15.040,"In a U.S. System, because the issue really is for the plaintiff to prove the statement false, there's a lot more comfort from the litigation side, from the protection side, from a journalist taking risks side, because putting a negative actually kind of hard to do.",Stuart,edited
00:04:55.760,00:05:20.779,00:00:25.019,"Because it's not, especially when you look at truth as a question of what's the gist of what you're trying to say, it doesn't have to be an absolute truth. It just has to be more likely than not that it's true, or not more likely than not, that it is false. And if you think Think about this in context of what we'll say, think about how... Easy it is to prove that at least something might have happened or could have happened, probably did happen, as opposed to proving that this absolutely did not happen.",Stuart,edited
00:05:21.340,00:05:39.029,00:00:17.689,"So there are, for example, with Johnny Depp, there are pictures out there of Amber Heard with injuries to her face. His allegation is that she did those herself to set him up, and there's a whole thing going on there. I don't in any way comment on the merits of anybody's position, but ... There are pictures of Amber Heard with injuries to her face.",Stuart,edited
00:05:39.090,00:06:05.949,00:00:26.859,"He's going to have to prove that those are not evidence of abuse. In the United Kingdom, because they're trying to prove it true, that in fact he did abuse his wife, they'll have to show what those pictures actually meant. They're going to show how they were taken, where they were, all that. And they're going have the burden of persuasion. And just that switch makes it just far more likely that a journalist will lose a lawsuit in the UK than the journalist would lose the exact same case on the exact the same issue in the United States.",Stuart,edited
