This is something that, at least in my class, we'll talk about in a serious way, a very serious point, about injunctions on grounds of national security, and we'll read the Pentagon Papers case. What I want to talk about now is actually a different kind of case in which people seek injunctions. The impact, though, of that effort to seek an injunction. Is the same and that is that it seeks an order that silences the press and prevents the publication of information that the press has whether that's a written publication, it's a video, or it's an audio.",Stuart,edited
00:00:54.300,00:01:18.422,00:00:24.122,"At some level, this stuff arises in very trivial matters. It tends to arise, and virtually almost always arises, in Commonwealth countries, or at least outside of the United States. The basis is privacy, that there is some story that a journalist has, the publication of which will somehow invade in a way that is deeply problematic, the privacy of some person. A person is almost always a celebrity.",Stuart,edited
00:01:20.240,00:01:37.625,00:00:17.385,Again a lot of times when this comes up it seems trivial um so there was for example a football player or soccer player as people in England would call him that's fellow on the right there and he was kevin gigs griggs and he Was having a prominent player at some team.,Stuart,edited
00:01:38.020,00:01:53.030,00:00:15.010,He was having an affair with that young woman who was a reality tv star and he went in and said look you can't publish this story because if you do you'll destroy my marriage Putting aside the question of the reason his marriage might have been in jeopardy was the fact he was having an affair with a reality TV star.,,edited
00:01:53.650,00:02:14.898,00:00:21.248,"Anyway, that injunction was put in place, and not only was there an injunction against publication of that story, but they sought an injunction against the report that there was an injunction. So it was called a super injunction. So not only can you report the fact that these two are having an affair, you can't report the fact that you're barred from reporting a story based on Mr Griggs.",Stuart,edited
00:02:15.930,00:03:02.460,00:00:46.530,"And that injunction served for some period of time. Another prominent case was, this is Sir Elton John and his husband, Mr. Furness, David Furnes. And there was a story that they sought to block the publication of in English court. In this case, there was actually extensive coverage of Mr.Furness' menage à trois with another married couple. And it was reported in the United States, it was recorded in Canada, it was report in other countries. It just wasn't reported in England because a judge, in this case, this fellow, entered an injunction saying, well, that would be a terrible thing for the children of this couple to hear about because they've sworn loyalty to each other.",Stuart,edited
00:03:03.010,00:03:37.860,00:00:34.850,"Again, ignoring the fact that Mr. Furness appears unquestionably to have had this liaison with this couple. And that injunction stayed in place until a member of Parliament stood up and said, yo, folks, there are 75,000 Britons tweeting and retweeting these stories as published outside of the United Kingdom. Why can't we just run the stories about it? It may not be what people want to read, but leave that up to them. And because he announced the name of the couple on the floor of Parliament, that story was published.",Stuart,edited
00:03:39.760,00:04:01.002,00:00:21.242,"'And again, this is all celebrity tittle-tattle and you know, whatever. And one can get more or less exorcised about it, but where Super Injunctions came from in the United Kingdom was a case involving this company, which has $1.5 billion in revenue most recently, $3 billion in profit. It's a trading company. They specialize in commodities and other forms of trade.",Stuart,edited
00:04:03.480,00:04:27.880,00:00:24.400,"In 2000s, they had a business in which they would dump basically toxic waste on the coast of Africa. And they would just dump it, they would buy it or take responsibility for it in the United Kingdom. And they just dumped it. And there was a report on this and the company Trafagura went in and got an injunction against the Guardian reporting on that business of theirs. And the consequences.",Stuart,edited
00:04:28.360,00:05:14.790,00:00:46.430,"And also on the report, a government report prepared, a Milton report is what it's called, the Guardian's report of that report so that no one would know what was going on, no one know it had been executed by the government, and no one wouldn't know that the traffic or a company had gotten in junction against the Guardian. That one lasted for about five weeks and then finally, again, a member of parliament said, look I'm going to get on the of parliament when there's privilege. And I'm going to announce this trafficker are doing this. And that collapsed the case. But until then, in the United Kingdom, this very prominent company could not be reported on by the English press because of this, in my mind, somewhat bizarre order. And that's what you get into these orders.",Stuart,edited
00:05:16.190,00:05:35.580,00:00:19.390,"More recently, in this case discussed in the textbook, there's a case involving Bloomberg where A fellow whose name isn't used, who is the subject of a criminal investigation involving multiple countries and is under investigation for engaging in illegal activity in developing world markets, countries.",Stuart,edited
00:05:37.200,00:06:44.779,00:01:07.579,"There's a part of that investigation. There is a request for information from the UK investigator and criminal investigator to another country for information about transactions that have occurred on this felon's responsibility or relationship to them. And again, there's a story published. And after that, the individual goes to the courts of another felon, it's not this exact guy, but looks a lot like him. Once you put somebody in a full body wig thing, they all kind of look like this. And said, look, you can't allow the publication of the story because I'm just being investigated. It's a terrible thing. I'll be acquitted. In the meantime, the fact that government is expending resource and looking for information is a matter of private concern to me, despite the presence and commitment of government resources. And that argument prevails. That argument prevails at trial. That argument is at trial court. That argument prevails at the Court of Appeal. And at the moment, Bloomberg News is prevented from reporting on this story or writing more about information it plainly has in its possession.",Stuart,edited
00:06:45.670,00:07:19.259,00:00:33.589,"And that's the concern about these injunctions and super injunctions. Because there's information that's available to the press. The press has not stolen the information. It's not promoted in some way. It has the information, has the story, and it's barred from publishing it. So if someone says they want a gag order, they want an injunction against you as a journalist, serious matter. You should take it seriously. Make sure your editors know and almost surely talk to a lawyer. Anyway, a scary area of the law and something that my hope is you will never be exposed to. Thank you.",Stuart,edited
